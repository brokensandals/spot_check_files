# spot\_check\_files

This is a tool to help validate the integrity of data backups/exports.

- Checks recognized file types for errors, e.g. invalid json.
- Selects some files at random to show you thumbnails of.

## Usage

Install:

1. Install python3 and pip
2. `pip3 install spot_check_files[imgcat]`
    - imgcat is optional and enables support for displaying thumbnails in iTerm2 on OS X

Run:

```bash
spot_check_files PATH
```

This will output basic stats and any problems the tool detects in the given files/directories.
If you're using iTerm2 on Mac, it will also show thumbnails of a few randomly-selected files.

The full list of options can be seen in the [doc folder](doc/).

This tool can also be used programmatically.
The main entry point for the library is [spot_check_files.checker.Checker](src/spot_check_files/checker.py).

## Supported file types

File types are currently recognized only by file extension.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>anything supported by OS X Quick Look (HTML, Office docs, ...)</td>
            <td>OS X ONLY: generates thumbnails using Quick Look. This greatly increases the number of supported file types. However, it's slow. See the <code>-q</code> command line option if you wish to partially or fully disable it.</td>

## Development

Setup:

1. Install python3 and pip
2. Clone the repo
3. I recommend creating a venv:
    ```bash
    cd spot_check_files
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
   pip install .
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

To run tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src pytest
```

(Overriding PYTHONPATH as shown ensures the tests run against the code in the src/ directory rather than the installed copy of the package.)

To run the CLI:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m spot_check_files ...
```
